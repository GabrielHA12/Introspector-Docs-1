## What It Is

Introspector is a modular offensive framework for observing and **weaponizing HTTP-based behavior** — including what happens *outside* the immediate response.

Instead of "I got a callback", you get **context**: what endpoint was hit, what chain happened next, what the client retried, whether it followed redirects, whether DNS was involved, and what payload was actually fetched.

## Core Capabilities

### Passive Traps
Set up HTTP listeners and DNS callbacks that capture detailed information about any client interactions.

### Payload Hosting
Generate ready-to-fetch endpoints with correct content types, or host custom files for testing.

### Redirect Intelligence  
Create tracking redirects and detect redirect-following behavior in real traffic patterns.

### Execution Tracing
Correlate HTTP + DNS activity to reconstruct the full execution path of vulnerability exploitation.

## Quick Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepsecurity-pe/Introspector.git
cd introspector-framework  
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
sudo python3 Introspector.py --persist session01
```

Then open the log UI printed in the console (e.g. `/logs-<id>`). You're ready to serve payloads and trace callbacks.
